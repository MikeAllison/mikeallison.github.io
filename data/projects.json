					"This was the project for Launch School's “Rapid Prototyping with Ruby on Rails” course.  To challenge myself, I added additional features that weren’t required by, or taught in, the course.

          "It has a Rails back-end with authentication built from scratch.  The front-end uses Bootstrap which I customized using SASS.

Finally, the project has a full set of unit and integration tests written with the Minitest framework."
